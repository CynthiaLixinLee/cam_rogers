          <h2>Quantum Break: Zero State</h2>
          <p>Jack Joyce spent six years trying to escape—escape his life, escape time, escape the madness of his brother, Will.
            But when he finally returns home, it turns out his brother isn’t quite so mad. Will has created a time machine,
            one with the potential to save humanity. War? Preventable. Natural disasters? Stoppable.</p>
          <p>Except for one tiny problem… his machine will also cause the end of time as we know it. Now Jack has just one chance
            to turn back time, to fix what was broken, to save the world.</p>

          <h2>The Music of Razors</h2>
          <p>In nineteenth-century Boston, a young doctor on the run from the law falls in with a British confidence artist.
            Together and with dire consequences, they bring back to the light something meant to be forgotten.</p>
          <p>A world away in London, an absent father, haunted by the voice of a banished angel, presents his daughter with
            an impossible friend: a clockwork ballerina.</p>
          <p>For two centuries, a bullet-removal specialist has wielded instruments of angel bone in service to a forgotten
            power . . . and now he vows to find someone else to shoulder the burden, someone with a conscience of their own,
            a strong mind, and a broken will. For a hundred years he has searched for the perfect contender, and now he has
            found two: a brother and a sister. Walter and Hope. Either will do.</p>
